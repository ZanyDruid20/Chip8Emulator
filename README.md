# STARTING
This is a CHIP-8 emulator developed for CMSC 411 (Computer Architecture) at UMBC. It implements the CHIP-8 virtual machine from scratch in C, including all major opcode instructions, memory management, keyboard input, and sprite rendering with SDL.


# FRIDAY 28TH OF MARCH 2025
Initialized the project. Set up folder structure and began the fetch-decode-execute loop.

# SATURDAY 29TH OF MARCH 2025
Started implementing opcodes. Used ChatGPT and CHIP-8 documentation to understand opcode structure and branching logic. See logs here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lCmzCjgPVxv5Ggl_tuwjT4JsQXTvIpe1bk6676Q8q4k/edit?usp=sharing

# SUNDAY 3OTH OF MARCH 2025
Implemented 0xD000 draw opcode and modularized chip8.h. Began work on header files and display.


# FRIDAY 18TH OF APRIL 2025
Finally implemented the registers with an arrays and the IBM logo came out successfully

EDITS:
```c
case 0xE000:
        switch(kk) {
            case 0x9E:
                if (chip8_register_read(registers[X])) {
                    pc += 2;
                }
                break;
            case 0xA1:
                if (!chip8_register_read(registers[X])) {
                    printf("Key %X is NOT pressed! Skipping instruction\n", registers[X]);
                    pc += 2;
                }
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
        break;

```

I packaged it within the 0x0E00 because the opcodes start with that and there are two remaining values with the kk register.

```c
case 0x55:
    for (int i = 0; i <= X; i++) {
        chip8_mem_write(I + i, registers[i]);
    }
    break;


```
Did the same as it is encoded within 0xF000

**CHIP-8 Debugging & Fixes (April 24–25, 2025)**

### 🧵 Session Summary

#### ✅ Prompt: “i cant edit sdlbasecode.c”  
**Response:** Use accessor functions to interact with `static` variables like `buttons` instead of directly referencing or redeclaring them. For `buttons`, use `chip8_register_read(i)` safely.

#### ✅ Prompt: “DT: 0” and font memory not loading  
**Response:** Verified that `chip8_mem_reset()` was clearing out font data due to `memset(mem, 0, 4096)` after loading the ROM. Fix: Re-inject font using `chip8_mem_write()` in `chip8_init()` like so:
```c
for (int i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    chip8_mem_write(0x050 + i, font[i]);
}
```
Edit:
```c
for(int i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
        chip8_mem_write(0x050 + i, chip8_mem_read(i));
}
```
I tested it and it worked out perfectly so i decided to leave it threre.

#### ✅ Prompt: “so what will happen to the header file”  
**Response:** To access shared variables across files without static conflicts, declare them as `extern` in the header file:
```c
extern uint8_t dt, st;
extern uint8_t buttons[16];
```
EDIT:
Didnt write that again

#### ✅ Prompt: “case 0x29… FX29 called”  
**Response:** Confirmed that `FX29` loads font address using `I = 0x050 + Vx * 5`. Ensure font is placed at 0x050 or the characters won’t show properly on screen.

```c
case 0xF029:
    uint8_t myCharacter = registers[X];
    I = 0x050 + (myCharacter * 5);
    break;
```
Edits:
```c
case 0x29:
    uint8_t myCharacter = registers[X];
    I = 0x050 + (myCharacter * 5);
    break;
```
Packaged it within the 0x7000 again
#### ✅ Prompt: “i cant move… can shoot”  
**Response:** Issue was from conflicting `buttons[]` access. Fixed by using `chip8_register_read(i)` in `FX0A` input-wait opcode.
```c
case 0xF00A:
        bool key_pressed = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
            if(buttons[i]) {
                registers[X] = i;
                key_pressed = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if(!key_pressed) {
            pc -= 2;
        }
        break;
```
Edits:
case 0x0A:
```c
        bool key_pressed = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
            if(chip8_register_read(i)) {
                registers[X] = i;
                printf("Button Values:  %d\n" , registers[X]);
                key_pressed = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if(!key_pressed) {
            pc -= 2;
        }
        break;
```

I packaged it within the 0x7000 since the register would start with register kk which gives the last two values
#### ✅ Prompt: “high score not shown after death”  
**Response:** Likely that high score was using BCD output (`FX33`) and needed fonts to render. Since `chip8_mem_reset()` cleared memory, fonts disappeared. Temporary solution was re-writing font after ROM load:
```c
chip8_mem_reset();
for (int i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    chip8_mem_write(0x050 + i, font[i]);
}
```
Edit:
``` c
    for(int i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
        chip8_mem_write(0x050 + i, chip8_mem_read(i));
    }
```

### Learning Outcomes

1. **Understanding of the CHIP8 Architecture:** Implemented fetch-decode-execute cycle, memory-mapped I/O, and opcode logic.
2. **Memory/Register Management:** Correct use of `mem`, `V0–VF`, `I`, `PC`, and `SP`.
3. **Opcode Instruction Handling:** Implemented `DXYN`, `FX29`, `FX33`, `FX0A`, `EX9E`, `EXA1`, etc.
4. **Debugging and Testing:** Used `printf()` to trace memory for visual bugs and input logic.
5. **SDL Integration:** Connected emulator to graphical output via `chip8_draw_sprite()` from  SDL basecode.
6. **Modular Design under Constraints:** Implemented the chip8 file without modifying the sdlbasecode.c ,I accessed it through calling its functions and linking it together during compilation
7. **Ethical Tool Usage:** Logged ChatGPT usage and maintained academic integrity with detailed prompt-to-edit tracking.

###  Opcode & Memory Debug Logs

## Opcode: `DXYN` (Draw Sprite)
```c
printf("DXYN: Drawing sprite from I=0x%03X at (%d,%d), height=%d\n", I, x, y, height);
for (int j = 0; j < height; j++) {
    printf("mem[0x%03X] = 0x%02X\n", I + j, chip8_mem_read(I + j));
}
```
Edits: Removed it after using it to debug
#### 🧮 Opcode: `FX33` (BCD Conversion)
```c
uint8_t val = registers[X];
chip8_mem_write(I, val / 100);
chip8_mem_write(I + 1, (val / 10) % 10);
chip8_mem_write(I + 2, val % 10);
```
```c
Edit:
uint8_t BCD = registers[X];
chip8_mem_write(I,BCD/100);
chip8_mem_write(I + 1, (BCD/10) % 10);
chip8_mem_write(I + 2, BCD % 10);
break;
```
#### 🧮 Font Dump
```c
printf("=== Font memory from 0x050 to 0x09F ===\n");
for (int i = 0x050; i < 0x050 + 80; i++) {
    printf("mem[%03X] = %02X\n", i, chip8_mem_read(i));
}
```
Edits: Removed that after debugging.
#### 🧮 Delay Timer Debug

printf("DT: %d\n", registers[CHIP8_REG_DT]);
```
Edits:
Removed that after testing for debug
